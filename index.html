                    <div class="col-sm-7">
                        <p>The prototype emerged from a group assignment, the objective of which was to report on and create a low-fidelity prototype the terminus of which was marked by completing the prototyping phase of the iterative design process. There was a valuable personal result from working with a group. I learned, I find it easiest to feel I’m contributing effectively by listening actively than to take an overly active role in mediation and organisation which I think was a behaviour that emerged in the beginning due to anxieties from screen alienation, and not having any social structuring with these other people. I reckon not only did it lack affect, my behaviour in the beginning but the control and need to progress might have also been a little testing for other members. I do find this a little harder, the more passive role. Yes, I’m listening more actively but there’s greater refrain in my behaviour, and anxiety around a lack of progress etc resulting in a whole new ecology of communication and am immediate experience of this. Additional to this greater listening is to be more active in providing tangible results ie, more a greater multitude of work being posted to the group etc. </p>

                        <p>In contrast my experience of the proceeding project, the individual one has been far more production and labour intensive. Like the group project the psychology here is still pressurised but, theres far greater affirmation a positive result from the energy expenditure and its results, despite being definably incremental. An unexpected aspect of learning, is what emerged from my readings on interviewing and the activity of interviewing. There was only one instance of organised interviewing; a semi-strucutured one. I learned an awful lot, and felt a sense of excitement and anticipation for future events in which I play the role of an interviewer.</p>

                        <p>The first prescribed assignment both within the interactive media module and the first semester. It entailed engaging in photography both through the use of the camera and post-processing techniques to think through the idea of life. The learning outcomes were primarily personal, accompanied by a greater understanding of post-processing process’s and their importance.</p>

                        <p>In reflection my engagement with this assignment was a little neglectful, or at least that’s how I felt having completed it. It dawned on me that this was the only facet of the first semester I had experience with. The use of a camera was implicit in most aspects of my bachelors degree in fine-art painting. Getting to grips with the course from the limits of a room in my house and the resulting acclimatisation tensions, im sure further structured my myopic, slightly arrogant approach. Its logical; tension is a visceral response to pressure, although I’m now addressing this with a greater fluidity of engagement, facilitating the shaping of thinking process’s specifically.</p>

                        <p>Further comments on the process of making the body of work: Although I have access to a decent slr, I found myself primarily engaging with my phone camera, knowing it possess’s perfectly adequate image capturing technology. Interestingly the lightroom app was limiting in that it didn’t facilitate adjusting the exposure while in pro mode. I also found it difficult to adjust certain settings to manual such as aperture and focus. I would have tried to outline a general focus and utilise my slr during the process. </p>

                <div class="col-sm-7">
                    <p> Very similar structurally to the photography assignment. The sound assignment delineated two options to choose from, a radio advert and a sound story. I picked the former. In retrospect my preference was based upon the appeal of it’s apparent tangibility and structure. It was the only assignment I’ve had this semester that didn’t evoke intense instability. The process was marked by an efficiency and clarity of labour, yet still maintained a sense of openness and searching. With the exception of the photography project my challenge to every other assignment has in fact been contrary to this.</p>
                    
                    <p>The project spanned no more than a week, from fomenting ideas, to gathering and composing sounds, and finally mixing and mastering the final project. My process involved gathering sounds from both sounds.org and recordings I made on my phone. I borrowed a basic  dynamic mic from my housemate, which incited a playfulness to making sounds and ultimately recording the voice-over. I then composed it through post-processing on audacity.</p>
                    
                    <p>My critical reflection isn’t to say that the assignment lacked affect or challenge. It possessed the correct discursive pressures, the challenges that unfolded were dialectically contained, yet well structured. In memory process seems traceable/map-able. Although my perception of it is ineffably defined by my current experience fo reality and how overwhelmed I now feel.</p>
                    
                    <p>Due to the context of my current reality and my encompassing psychology, my reflections could in fact be fantasmatically compromised, the grass could have in fact been greener in the past, but who knows.</p>
                    
                    <p>My only criticism of the body of work is that it might have lacked dynamism. I will highlight a few things I could have potentially developed the project further and potentially improved my grade - a larger deposit of sound resources to display a greater time and effort spent recording and gathering materials and building the relationships with them and have this greater intensity of material shape my approach to the composition. Additionally I could have also spent greater time mastering the sound effects, especially applied to the voice-over.</p>

                        <p>This is one of a few other facets (generally speaking) that I found especially hard this semester, which was only exacerbated by the remote learning imposed through a covid-19 lockdown and the universities policies around this. Analogous to this, is an image of mining hard-rock with manual tools. It entails toil, and the hope that something desirable might be encountered. The learning curve at times seems vertical and scaling it involves a yet to encounter transcendent skill.</p>

                        <p>The assignment entails the building and design of an online portfolio of work produced. during the first semester and could optionally include work from beyond college. I think the most indicative of this difficulty level and really the greatest casualty as a result is the amount of time I have spent trying to both assimilate information and apply that. Given the conditions of remote learning and the experience of lacking skills and habits, this application of information and skills can mean trying to solve and design a feature over the course of a few hours.</p>

                        <p>One thing I might have benefitted from here and in other similar cases is asking for help and taking asking for help seriously. The only remedial understanding of this is bound to the experience of receiving one to one tutorial based help in which I’m provided an answer for something I’m trying to do and I learn this and then apply it in practice. Writing this has elucidated that this tension/phenomenology of isolated learning and my experience of that(described in previous posts) still has affect, it promotes a head down attitude.</p>
                        
                        <p>All said, this arduousness is also, often accompanied by a feeling of progress and affirmation when completing and implementing a feature successfully. Id love to spend a bit more time developing the site focussing especially on j-query. While improving my coding skills it could also provide me with a host to begin blogging/writing on matters beyond college.</p>
