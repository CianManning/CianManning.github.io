        <p>Hey All!</p>
        
        <p>My name is Cian, I’m from Cork, but living in Limerick.</p>
        
        <p>I graduated from Fine art Painting in 2018 from Limerick School of Art and Design. There I developed a strong interest in philosophy and writing and a love for making things.</p>
        
        <p>I have worked as a barista in speciality coffee here in Limerick since graduating, even competing a number of times. </p>
        
        <p>I was previously a member of <a href="https://www.spacecraftlimerick.com/">Spacecraft Artists’ Studios</a> and I still maintain a writing and fine art practice.</p>
        
        <p>I am most excited to augment my artistic skills to a user centred design framework.</p>
